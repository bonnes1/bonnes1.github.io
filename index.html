        countries to see how their values changes over the years, click to filter different Culture Zones or brush the different

        <p style="font-weight: bold">Values over time and comparison</p>
        <p>By searching for different countries you can notice how different values have changed over time. By searching
        for e.g. Sweden you can notice the values of emphasis on universal freedoms in the domain of reproductive choices (EV_choice) has drastically increased.
            By filtering out all but "Reformed West" (somewhat central Europe) we can see a trending pattern of values that
            are similar to each of these countries. Even more interesting, when comparing "Reformed West" with "Orthodox East" we can notice very different values in the matter
            of emphasis in the domain of universal freedoms in both reproductive choices but also people's voice.
        </p>

    <td>
        <p style="font-weight: bold">Overall difference in variables</p>
        <p>By brushing a small timespan of about 5 years and comparing from the 1980s and the 2010s you can compare all
        the different variables. One noticeable structure is how the countries from later years are more spread in their values
        compared to earlier years. E.g. how the people consider their own health is very widespread in the 2010s
        compared to earlier years where it seems like people from various countries would consider themselves as more healthy.
        The reason for this could simply be because of less data points in the 1980s compared to 2010s but if you exclude that, one reason
        of the pattern could be because of the environmental challenges that people are more aware of today compared to the 1980s.</p>

    <td><p>This project have been pretty challenging to be honest. I used the d3 library of parallel coordinates from Kai who have
        delivered very nice examples of parallel coordinates and his examples have helped a lot. I found the most difficult thing was
        to get the data to work properly, but with a lot of searching on the internet and comparing with other similar
        projects using parallel coordinates it worked in the end. I have also learned more about how to host severs by trying with firebase
        but in the end using github pages. </p></td>
